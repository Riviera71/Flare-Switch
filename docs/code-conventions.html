<h2>Contributing Code</h2>

<p>The #1 rule of this project: <em>all non-trivial code changes must be discussed first!</em></p>

<p>Years of careful decision-making have gone into all parts of this project. Some designs are awaiting planned future changes. If you submit a large patch without knowing how it will affect past and future code, <strong>it will be rejected</strong>.</p>

<p>Is my code non-trivial? If it touches multiple functions or files, probably so.</p>

<p>Ways to discuss a desired code change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Email me (clintbellanger@gmail.com)</li>
<li>Open an Issue</li>
<li>Join us on IRC (#flarerpg at freenode)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

<p>When possible, use small pull requests that keep the engine in a stable state. It is far better to have many small pull requests than to wait until your change is too large to merge.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re working on more than one feature, submit pull requests separately for these. Some times we need to accept one change and reject the other; if your pull request is all combined I have to reject the entire thing.</p>

<h2>Cross-platform considerations</h2>

<p>To the best of our ability, we want the code to work on Windows, OSX, Linux and more. We try to isolate platform-specific code and use C preprocessor directives when necessary.</p>

<h2>OOP as a last resort</h2>

<p>My code is simple (some would say not elegant). I start by coding it the simplest possible way that would work. I have a deep disdain for overengineering.</p>

<p>Action RPGs are a really simple genre. We don&rsquo;t need fully OOP Entity system to create these games.</p>

<p>We have introduced OOP as needed, when the solution makes much more sense than the added complexity. We won&rsquo;t needlessly refactor working code.</p>

<h2>No C++11 / C++0x</h2>

<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll allow this kind of code in the future. But Flare has a presence on obscure platforms; I can&rsquo;t guarantee that the compilers have kept up.</p>

<h2>Indentation</h2>

<p>I try to use tabs. I don&rsquo;t really care though, as long as a single file is internally consistent.</p>

<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>Here are the basic conventions, which are not really consistent. Not a big deal, I sometimes clean these up as I go.</p>

<ul>
<li>ClassName::functionName</li>
<li>ClassName::class_variable</li>
<li>local_variable</li>
<li>ENUM_OR_CONSTANT</li>
</ul>


<h2>Commenting</h2>

<p>I try to use Javadoc style comments on functions, especially if they&rsquo;re non-obvious.</p>

<p>I try to avoid block comments inside functions (so it&rsquo;s easy to block comment out an entire function).</p>

<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p>Avoid polluting the project&rsquo;s namespace. This means no <code>using namespace std</code>. Instead, prefix the appropriate names with the <code>std::</code> syntax (e.g. <code>std::vector</code>, <code>std::string</code>, <code>std::min()</code>, etc)</p>
