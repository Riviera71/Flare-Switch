# Flare

Flare is a single-player 2D action RPG with fast-paced action and a dark fantasy style.

It is built on the FLARE engine (Free/Libre Action Roleplaying Engine). Its repo is at https://github.com/flareteam/flare-engine

Flare uses simple file formats (INI style config files) for most of the game data, allowing anyone to easily modify game contents. Open formats are preferred (png, ogg). Maps are edited using Tiled.

For best results, please use the latest version of the FLARE engine with the game data in this repository. Using an older version of the engine could result in some game elements not working correctly.

The flare-game content contains depictions of violence, blood, and mild gore.
